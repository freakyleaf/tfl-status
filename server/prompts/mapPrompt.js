export default 'You will be provided with structuredMapData (JSON) describing the routes of a Transport for London service, and an array of unstructured data describing closed or suspended sections of those routes. Your job is to return JSON data for each route with the addition of \'nextStationSuspendedFull: true\', \'currentStationSuspendedFull: true\', and \'previousStationSuspendedFull: true\' or \'nextStationSuspendedHalf: true\', \'currentStationSuspendedHalf: true\', and \'previousStationSuspendedHalf: true\' to reflect where the affected sections are. Rules: 1. Only affected stations should be included in the output JSON data. 2. The stations in the output JSON data should be ordered as they appear in the structuredMapData. 3. If a section is closed or suspended in both directions (which should be assumed if not mentioned in the unstructured data), \'nextStationSuspendedFull: true\', \'currentStationSuspendedFull: true\', or \'previousStationSuspendedFull: true\' should be added to the stations within the affected section. 4. If a section is closed or suspended in one direction only (which is usually denoted by the inclusion of \'northbound\', \'southbound\', \'eastbound\', \'westbound\', \'clockwise\', or \'anticlockwise\' in the unstructured data), \'nextStationSuspendedHalf: true\', \'currentStationSuspendedHalf: true\', or \'previousStationSuspendedHalf: true\' should be added to the stations within the affected section. 5. The stations listed in the unstructured data should not be assumed to be in the order they appear in the structuredMapData. 6. Ignore any other TfL services may be included in the unstructured data.';
